# MOTION

## Purpose

To explore and apply the wide range of animations offered by **Framer Motion** as well as applying only **Tailwindcss** for styling and positionning, this project is exclusively targetted towards practice and exercice. It's purpose is to implement **frontend** design, making the process faster and more effective with **Tailwindcss** and enhance the User Experience with many interactions via **Framer Motion**. Let's still have some fun with it!

## Process

I needed some time and look around to finally set up **Tailwindcss**, now it's up and running ! Let's Start !!

I found out today that with **Tailwind**, if you want to write the long class names in a CSS file and @apply these, you have to assign them to the _html_ **element** and not the _className_. Using the most common _elements_ in web, it forces to think custom **tailwind** lines in a clear and organised way. Assigning them by _elements_ gives more concistency.
